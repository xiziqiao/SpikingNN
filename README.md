This is a simple example of converting google speech command (http://download.tensorflow.org/data/speech_commands_v0.02.tar.gz) to spiking data using speech2spike package (https://doi.org/10.1145/3584954.3584995). I simply took one audio command and encoded it with spiking representation. It is just a simple demo of how to use it.
